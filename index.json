For front-end network, conv-based LoRA modules are used to adapt to speaker’s space features. For back-end network, a plug-and-play TAWL module is designed to learn temporal characteristics. An Adapter module is finally employed to bridge the adaptation knowledge from front-end and back-end.

Lip features are disentangled into three parts, i.e. the static identity features, the dynamic identity features and the content features by the proposed TDVSA-Net. The experiment results show that the content features obtained the lowest WER in speaker- independent lip-reading compared with other lipreading models, and the identity features had comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods on detecting human imposters and DeepFake imposters and exhibits more robustness when facing different image qualities. Therefore, our VSA system can be a feasible solution for today’s widely used mobile applications.\n","date":1704844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704844800,"objectID":"5fd4b6501903f192356210148aa1e793","permalink":"https://yangleisx.github.io/publication/tcsvt-vsa/","publishdate":"2024-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tcsvt-vsa/","section":"publication","summary":"Lip features are disentangled into three parts, i.e. the static identity features, the dynamic identity features and the content features by the proposed TDVSA-Net.","tags":[],"title":"Lip Feature Disentanglement for Visual Speaker Authentication in Natural Scenes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lei Yang","ShilinWang","Alan Wee-Chung Liew"],"categories":null,"content":" In this paper, we proposed a new lip segmentation method based on fuzzy convolutional neural network with graph reasoning that can learn high-level semantics. The fuzzy learning module and the fuzzy graph reasoning module help the deep convolutional neural network to handle uncertainties around ambiguous boundaries, capture global information, and improve multi-class lip region segmentation. In addition, a fine-grained lip region dataset is released for multi-class segmentation studies. Our proposed approach achieved satisfactory performance on the test set, with 94.36% pixel accuracy and 74.89% mIoU. The experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed method can be applied in many lip-related applications to obtain accurate and robust lip region segmentation in natural scenes.\nHowever, the proposed network cannot achieve satisfactory results in certain scenarios, specifically in cases of occlusion or extreme lighting conditions. This limitation can be attributed to the FLRSeg dataset, which is derived from the VSA dataset that was collected for speaker authentication and thus required unobstructed lip movements. In our future work, we will further improve the segmentation performance in various situations and explore the potential of leveraging the segmentation results in downstream tasks, such as lip reading and visual speaker authentication, to enhance performance and accelerate converge.\n","date":1690156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690156800,"objectID":"94f8e2e9184f2654bf74ce49a32462c5","permalink":"https://yangleisx.github.io/publication/tfs-lip-seg/","publishdate":"2024-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tfs-lip-seg/","section":"publication","summary":"A new lip segmentation method based on fuzzy convolutional neural network with graph reasoning that can learn high-level semantics is proposed.","tags":[],"title":"Fine-Grained Lip Image Segmentation using Fuzzy Logic and Graph Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fangqi Li","Lei Yang","Shilin Wang","Alan Wee-Chung Liew"],"categories":null,"content":" This paper presents MTLSign, an MTL-based DNN watermarking scheme. We examine the basic security requirements for the DNN watermark, especially the unambiguity, and propose to embed the watermark as an additional task.\nThe proposed scheme explicitly meets security requirements by corresponding regularizers. With a decentralized consensus protocol, MTLSign is secure against adaptive attacks. It is true that like any other white-box DNN watermarking scheme, MTLSign remains vulnerable to functionality equivalence attacks such as the neuron permutation. This is one of the aspects that require further effort to increase the applicability of DNN watermarks.\n","date":1646006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646006400,"objectID":"4ef88e8dc053666bc23b5353aadd54ff","permalink":"https://yangleisx.github.io/publication/aaaiw-mtl-watermark/","publishdate":"2024-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aaaiw-mtl-watermark/","section":"publication","summary":"MTLSign, an MTL-based DNN watermarking scheme","tags":null,"title":"Leveraging Multi-task Learning for Unambiguous and Flexible Deep Neural Network Watermarking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Hugo Blox Builder Hugo Blox Builder | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
